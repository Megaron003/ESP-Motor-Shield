# ESP-Motor-Shield
Thoose are THE RULES of ESP Motor Shield to make this thing work! \(ÒuÓ)/

Obs.: This shield is hard to do work, but

1° D8 pin may not stay connected when you will do the code update for your ESP. Connect pin after the update and star engines (Cauntion!).
2° Although the Shield makes all digital pins available for use four of the eight pins will be used by the motors connected to the terminals.
